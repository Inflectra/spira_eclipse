# SpiraTeam Plugin for Eclipse

This plugin works in conjunction with the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) for implementing requirements, completing
tasks and fixing incidents. Rather than creating and designing a whole new user-interface from scratch, this plug-in uses the built-in
Mylyn task-based interface that allows Eclipse users to manage their local tasks and those in any compatible repository in a single
interface.
